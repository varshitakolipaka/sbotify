# Sbotify
Make public playlists with friends on the MusiCoco Spotify Account, or authorise the bot to manage your account.

## Using the Bot to make Public Playlists on Discord

### Setup
You can directly use the bot by inviting it to your server on this [link](<>)

Alternatively, you can customise the bot for your usage, or run locally by changing the `.env`. 

- Update your `SPOTIFY_USER_ID`
- Update your `SPOTIFY_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN`
- Update your `CLIENT_ID`
- Update your `CLIENT_SECRET`

You will also require a refresh token incase you want to change the auth token. You can get it [here](https://getyourspotifyrefreshtoken.herokuapp.com/)
